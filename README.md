# rh-osp-d8-install
## Some hints and scripts for installation of RH OpenStack Platform using Director 8

These scripts somehow automate actions described in [the manual](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/paged/director-installation-and-usage/).

They aren't intended for use "as is", treat'em as templates (at least read them before execute!).
